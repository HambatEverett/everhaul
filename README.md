Everhaul! is a minecraft datapack, designed for 1.21.10 java and first created on 1.21.8 java. It adds many new features and much content, including drinks, food, money, and many more things.

To put it short and sweet, its a modern OpenBlocks datapack.

Currently, the only main features are new drinks and drugs.

There isnt much after that.</br>
But currently, i am working on the next chapter of this datapack.

The **Fattening Foods** update will add more depth to the weight system, things like caffeine have actual effects on you, and well obviously im adding food.

made with love <3
